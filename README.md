The project analyzes e-commerce store performance, exploring website traffic, customer behavior, and product/brand performance. Developed using Python, it includes extensive dataset cleaning, analysis, and visualizations. Time series analysis reveals peak customer traffic at 7:00 pm, with engagement during special sales events. Customers prefer lower-priced products, and strategic adjustments can optimize costs during low activity and capitalize on peak engagement. Some products have low cart conversion rates, suggesting a barrier; recommendations include enhancing product listings and leveraging social proof for increased purchase intent.
