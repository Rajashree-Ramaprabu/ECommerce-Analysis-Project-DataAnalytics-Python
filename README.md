This project seeks to analyze the performance of an e-commerce store through an exploration of website traffic, customer behavior, and products and brands performance. Our observation shows that the E-commerce customers prefer lower-priced products, with peak purchases at 7:00 pm and often engaging during special sales events and this can be used to drive strategy adjustments, optimizing costs during low night-time activity and capitalizing on peak morning engagement and potential for enhanced night sales through promotions. Most of the E-Commerce customers visits the site only for viewing the site and the products displayed. E-Commerce customers are more likely to choose brands that are cheaper and affordable. During our analysis, we observed that some products had a low cart conversion rate, indicating a potential barrier in the buying process. We recommend enhancing product listings with comprehensive details and leveraging social proof, such as highlighting popular products and showcasing real-time user activity, to boost purchase intent. Our analysis underscores the importance of customer experience and product quality for brand success. To enhance performance, the store should focus on improving user experience, addressing quality concerns, and collaborating with popular brands, ensuring sustained appeal and increased sales.
